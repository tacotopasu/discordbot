# Discord Bot (No name yet)

A discord bot I've been coding to learn nodejs and how discord bots work.


## Features

- Message Delete/Edit Logs
- Music feature (Supports Spotify and Youtube)
- Interaction commands (Hug, punch, kiss, ...)
- Moderation features like banning, kicking, etc.
- Economy System (Balance, paying, ...)
- And more features being added regularly
